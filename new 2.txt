Interrupt v Trap.
Interrupt: allows the hardware to inform the CPU of an important event. (Hardware generated), can occur at any time. Asynchronous Process
Trap: Software generated event that has the kernel achieve a task. (Software generated), Synchronous Process. 
	- All Traps are interrupts, not all interrupts are traps.

Disabling Interrupt: 

DMA (Direct Memory Access): A feature of computer systems allows hardware to access the main system memory.

Operating System Service: 
Provides: 
	- UI: Command Line (CLI), Graphical User Interface (GUI), touch=screen, Batch
	- Program Execution: The system must be able to load a program into memory.
	- I/O operation - A running program may requiere I/O 
	- File Service
	- Commnications / Networking - May be via packets, memory
	- Error Detection - Os needs to be constantly aware of possible errors.
	
OS Structure Monolithic Kernel
A monolithic kernel is an OS architecture where the entire OS is working.

Micro Kernel: todo

System Call: When you ask for something you are calling through the system.
Win32 API, POSIX API (portable operating system interface), (linux, mac os x), Java API on the JVM
Implementation: Typically, a number is associated with each system call. call id,
The system call interface invokes the intended system call in OS kernel.
Design: 
	- Issued by a user land program.
	- Runime library is invoked
	- Runime library prepares the data and hands it to the system call interface.
	- System call causes a trap and the system call identifier is proved to the kernel,
	- The kernel uses the system call handler and returns the data to the caller,
	- Kernel uses the ID to finished and find when the system call is completed.
	
API - System Call - OS Relationship.

Types: File management, Device Manager (request device, release device, read, write, reposiion, get device attributes, logically attach or detach
devises from ther code.

Linkers and Loaders:
Linker: combines source code into single binary executable files. Also brings in libraries. <! Grabs dependencies, included files ->
	- Program resides on secondary storage as a binary executable
Loaders: Loads the program into memory. Makes the system call. 

Kernel: The way are data structured ino the system.
	- Computer has 2 mode of OS
		- Kernel Mode
		- User Mode
	- The OS is the most fundamental piece of software and runs in the kernal in superviser mode. 
	- In superviser mode the OS has access to all of the hardware.
	- Everything running in kernel mode is clearly a part of OS, but some program...
	
Microkernels:
	- Moves as much from the kernal into user space
	- Mach is an example of Microkernels.
		- Mach OS X kernel (Darwin) partly based on Mach
	- Communication takes place between user modules using message passing
	- Extends the kernel
	- Traditional OS functions, such as device drivers, protocol stacks, and file systems, are typically remove from the microkernel
	itself and are instead run in user space.
