# Flags to the C compiler. You may add to this but do NOT
# remove from it. The base required flags are
# -Wall and -pedantic. The -g flag compiles your code with

# The -I option tells the compiler additional places to
# look for header files.
CFLAGS=-g -Wall -pedantic -I head

# The name of the object files (modify as needed)
# Basically this is just all our C files with a .o
# extension.

# How to link together all the object files
# Do NOT modify
LINK.c= $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)

# How to compile all the source files
# Do NOT modify.
%.o:%.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $<

# Options to make.
